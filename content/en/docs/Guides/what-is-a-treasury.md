# Definition

Treasuries are where digital assets are stored and can be managed from, where the assets are managed by more than one party, usually in the form of a multi-signature wallet. Generally, treasuries are managed or directed by a group of people that own governance tokens that represent an amount of decision-making authority over a treasury’s assets.

Similar to the concept of corporate treasuries in business, treasuries in Web3 are often referred to in DAO parlance, defining the place where the DAO’s assets are held and managed.

However, the concept of a treasury in Web3 exists outside of DAOs as well. Treasuries are the building blocks of distributed organizations and groups of people who want to share assets, such as DAOs, co-ops, or collectives. They have the ability to interface with Web3 tools & DeFi.

# Move Treasuries

The Move platform provides treasuries that are programmable. They are akin to Web3-powered accounts that can receive funds and transparently and automatically distribute funds & digital assets (e.g., governance tokens) based on a set of rules. Tokens or NFTs that can be minted by the treasury system can represent given utilities or governance power over the treasury’s assets. The treasury can be managed by a distributed group of people using a treasury’s native token and/or NFTs through Web3 voting tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), or eventually through the Move platform directly.
