# Keep it fungi.

Myco-rrhiza is the mutualistic relationship of a mycelial neural net with the trees and plants of our forest.
Mycelial intelligence has guided and nurtured the progression of our ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, helping life to survive the past five major extinction events on Earth. Mycelium has sponsored global ecological thriving through the effective use of decentralized intelligence and coordination. No one part of a mycelial network can be targeted to destroy the entire being. It's about time that we humans take note and collaborate with the functional coordination systems of fungus. Blockchain is a key primitive in our path toward modeling the antifragile systemic solutions for global mutual benefit. Contribute your Rinkeby ETH at https://rinkeby.juicebox.money/#/@myco if you wanna grow some hyphal-tips. Your monetary energy will be deployed into the reciprocal fields of ecological intelligence regulated by fungal bodies whose time-preference far exceeds your own and even that of the human species.
